Hi, this is the NN(neural network), that was learning with MNIST_Fashion dataset, that contains 50000 example images and labels, and 10000 test images and labels.
It was made for my course work in my university.

You can use already trained NN by just pulling repository and use only saved_net.py

File neural_network_params.npz contains trained with 3 epochs NN.

In the code you have comments, that are written in Russian, because I'm a russian student, and i was showing my code to the professor.

I think that's it. It's pretty simple project, so you can easily understand what i was doing in it.
